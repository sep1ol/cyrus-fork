AI development agent for Linear powered by Claude Code. Cyrus monitors Linear issues assigned to it, creates isolated Git worktrees for each issue, runs Claude Code sessions to process them, and posts responses back to Linear as comments, all from the safety and security of your own computer.

**Please Note: Cyrus is built entirely on the premise that you bring your own Claude Code keys/billing. Subscribing to Cyrus Pro gets you priority support, convenience of not hosting a Linear app and cloudflare worker, and funds feature development. You can also host the proxy yourself if you don't wish to pay for that convenience. Documentation coming soon.**

## Installation

### Via npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g cyrus-ai
```

## Quick Start

#### Optional

(optional, if you want Cyrus to push PRs to Github): Have [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) (Github) installed. `brew install gh` or find your platform instructions at [this link](https://cli.github.com/). Authenticate using `gh auth login` as the user you want PRs to be submitted via.

#### Run the main program:

```bash
cyrus
```

#### Follow the prompts to:

- Connect your Linear workspace via OAuth
- Configure your repository settings
- Set up allowed tools (security configuration), and optionally, mcp servers

#### Benefit

Keep `cyrus` running, and the agent will start monitoring issues assigned to you in Linear and process them automatically, on your very own device.

## Setup on Remote Host

If you want to host Cyrus on a remote machine for 24/7 availability, follow these steps on a newly created virtual machine to get started.

1. Install `gh`, `npm`, and `git`

```bash
apt install -y gh npm git
```

2. Install `claude` and `cyrus` via `npm`

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code cyrus-ai
```

3. Set up `git` CLI

```bash
ssh-keygen
# Follow the prompts then paste the public key into GitHub

git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john.doe@example.com"
```

4. Login to `gh` and paste in an authentication token

```bash
gh auth login
```

5. Clone your repository via SSH into a folder of your choice

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git
```

6. Authenticate `claude`

```bash
claude
# Then follow the prompts


# If you are on subscription based pricing, you can verify this is setup properly by running `/cost` in the claude console and seeing if it specifies your subscription plan.
```

7. Configure an environment variable file to specify your domain and webhook settings

```bash
# Server configuration (handles both webhooks and OAuth callbacks)
CYRUS_SERVER_PORT=3456

# Base URL configuration (required for Linear integration - handles both webhooks and OAuth)
CYRUS_BASE_URL=<your publicly accessible URL>

# Legacy environment variables (still supported for backward compatibility)
# CYRUS_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=<url>  # Use CYRUS_BASE_URL instead
# CYRUS_WEBHOOK_PORT=3456  # Use CYRUS_SERVER_PORT instead
```

### Webhook Configuration Options

Cyrus needs to receive webhooks from Linear, so you need a publicly accessible URL. Choose one of these options:

**Option 1: Using ngrok (for development/testing)**
```bash
# In a separate tmux session
tmux new -s ngrok-session
ngrok http 3456
# Note the ngrok URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok-free.app)
# Ctrl+B then D to detach

# Set the environment variables
export CYRUS_BASE_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
export CYRUS_SERVER_PORT=3456
```

**Option 2: Direct server with domain/IP**
```bash
# If your server has a public IP or domain
export CYRUS_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
# or
export CYRUS_BASE_URL=http://your-server-ip
export CYRUS_SERVER_PORT=3456
```

**Option 3: Behind reverse proxy (nginx, caddy, etc.)**
```bash
# Configure your reverse proxy to forward /webhook and /callback to localhost:3456
export CYRUS_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
export CYRUS_SERVER_PORT=3456
```

8. Start the cyrus server

```bash
cyrus --env-file=<path>

# Optional
# Start cyrus in a tmux session for
tmux new -s cyrus-session # Can name whatever you'd like
# Ctrl-B -> D to exit
# To later 'attach' to it again
tmux attach -t cyrus-session
```

## Repository Setup Script

Cyrus supports an optional `cyrus-setup.sh` script that runs automatically when creating new git worktrees for issues. This is useful for repository-specific initialization tasks.

### How it works

1. Place a `cyrus-setup.sh` script in your repository root
2. When Cyrus processes an issue, it creates a new git worktree
3. If the setup script exists, Cyrus runs it in the new worktree with these environment variables:
   - `LINEAR_ISSUE_ID` - The Linear issue ID
   - `LINEAR_ISSUE_IDENTIFIER` - The issue identifier (e.g., "CEA-123")
   - `LINEAR_ISSUE_TITLE` - The issue title

### Example Usage

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cyrus-setup.sh - Repository initialization script

# Copy environment files from a central location
cp /Users/agentops/code/ceedar/packages/evals/.env packages/evals/.env

# Install dependencies if needed
# npm install

# Set up test databases, copy config files, etc.
echo "Repository setup complete for issue: $LINEAR_ISSUE_IDENTIFIER"
```

Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x cyrus-setup.sh`

## Submitting Work To GitHub

When Claude creates PRs using the `gh` CLI tool, it uses your local GitHub authentication. This means:

- All PRs and commits will be created under your GitHub account
- Comments and mentions in the PR will notify your account
- Review requests will be attributed to you
- Your repository permissions apply to all operations
- The only indication that Claude assisted is the "Co-Authored-By" commit trailer
