## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.36] - 2025-01-31

### Added
- Instant response is now sent when receiving follow-up messages in an existing conversation, providing immediate feedback that Cyrus is working on the request
  - Shows "I've queued up your message as guidance" when Cyrus is still processing a previous request
  - Shows "Getting started on that..." when Cyrus is ready to process the new request immediately
- Parent branch inheritance for sub-issues - sub-issue branches now automatically use their parent issue's branch as the base instead of the default repository branch
  - Maintains proper Git hierarchy matching Linear's issue structure
  - Gracefully falls back to default base branch if parent branch doesn't exist
  - Clear logging shows branch inheritance decisions
- Model notification at thread initialization - Cyrus now announces which Claude model is being used (e.g., "Using model: claude-3-opus-20240229") when starting work on an issue
- Task tool execution markers in Linear comments - Cyrus now clearly indicates when automated Task tools are running
  - Tools invoked within a Task display "↪ ToolName" to indicate they're part of the Task
  - Shows "✅ Task Completed" when the Task finishes and displays the output from the Task

### Added
- Instant acknowledgment responses when Cyrus receives a request, providing immediate feedback to users
- Role mode notifications when issue labels trigger specific workflows (e.g., "Entering 'debugger' mode because of the 'Bug' label")

## [0.1.31] - 2025-01-09

### CLI
- cyrus-ai@0.1.31

### Added
- Work on multiple tasks within a single Linear issue - each comment thread maintains its own Claude session, letting you tackle different parts of a problem in parallel without context mixing. New root comments start focused sessions that see the full conversation history in a threaded view (just like Linear's UI) while concentrating on your specific request
- Automatic ngrok tunnel setup for external access
  - No more manual port forwarding or reverse proxy setup required
  - Cyrus will ask for your ngrok auth token on first run and handle the rest
  - Free ngrok account required (sorry, we can't make the internet work by magic alone)
  - Skip ngrok setup if you prefer to handle networking yourself
- Webhook debugging via `CYRUS_WEBHOOK_DEBUG=true` environment variable - see exactly what Linear is (or isn't) sending you

### Fixed
- Fresh startup no longer crashes with "EdgeWorker not initialized" error when trying to connect to Linear
- OAuth flow now works properly on first run (turns out asking for credentials before having a way to receive them was... problematic)
- Git worktrees now work with local-only repositories (no more "fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository" when you're just trying to test things locally)
- Webhooks now register with the correct URL (ngrok/public URL instead of localhost)

### Packages

#### cyrus-edge-worker
- cyrus-edge-worker@0.0.16
- Added ngrok tunnel support for automatic public URL generation
- Fixed webhook URL registration to use public URLs
- Added getPublicUrl() method to SharedApplicationServer

#### cyrus-ndjson-client
- cyrus-ndjson-client@0.0.12
- Fixed webhook URL registration to use external server's public URL when available

## [0.1.30] - 2025-01-07

### CLI
- cyrus-ai@0.1.30

### Fixed
- Fixed critical crash issue where subprocess failures would bring down the entire application
  - Added global error handlers to prevent uncaught exceptions from terminating the process
  - Improved error isolation for individual Claude sessions - failures no longer affect other running sessions
  - Enhanced error logging with detailed stack traces for better debugging

## [0.1.25] - 2025-01-06

### CLI
- cyrus-ai@0.1.25

  - Automatically configures `@tacticlaunch/mcp-linear` server with repository's Linear token
  - Adds 30+ Linear MCP tools for issue management, comments, projects, and more
  - No additional configuration needed - works out of the box with existing Linear tokens

### Changed
- ClaudeRunner now supports array of MCP config paths for composable configurations
- ClaudeRunner supports inline MCP server configurations alongside file-based configs
- MCP configurations from files and inline sources are merged together

### Fixed
- Fixed webhook signature verification failures after restarting cyrus by extending edge worker registration TTL from 1 hour to 90 days
  - Resolves "Webhook signature verification failed for all registered handlers" error that occurred when cyrus was stopped and restarted
  - Edge worker registrations in the proxy now persist for 90 days instead of expiring after 1 hour

### Improved
- New comments on Linear issues queue up when Cyrus is already busy working, so that you can send multiple in a row ([#77](https://github.com/ceedaragents/cyrus/pull/77)) (now feed into existing Claude sessions instead of killing and restarting the session

### Packages

### Changed
