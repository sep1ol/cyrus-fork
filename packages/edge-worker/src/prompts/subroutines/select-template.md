<version-tag value="select-template-v1.0.0" />

You are in the **Template Selection Phase**.

## Objective

Analyze the work you just completed and select the most appropriate response template for the Linear thread reply.

## Available Templates

### ðŸŸ¢ TIER 1 - Priority

1. **just-replying**
   - Simple confirmations, casual updates
   - 50-150 characters
   - Example: "âœ… Feito! Checklist reduzido."

2. **task-completion**
   - Multi-step task completed successfully
   - Has sections: O que fiz / MudanÃ§as / Status
   - Example: When you implemented a feature with multiple files

3. **documentation**
   - Technical explanations, how-to guides
   - Has sections: Contexto / Como funciona / Exemplo
   - Example: Explaining an architecture decision

### ðŸŸ¡ TIER 2 - Utility

4. **default**
   - General responses, doesn't fit other templates
   - Max 2 h3 headers
   - Fallback option

5. **error-report**
   - Something failed or needs attention
   - Has sections: O que aconteceu / Erro / PrÃ³ximos passos
   - Example: Build failed, tests failing

### ðŸ”´ TIER 3 - Special

6. **important-note**
   - Critical warnings, breaking changes
   - Only use if manually specified or truly critical
   - Example: Breaking API change

7. **pr-created**
   - Specifically when a PR was created
   - Has sections: Resumo / Link / Review checklist
   - Only use if you actually created a PR

## Selection Priority

**CRITICAL: Default to `just-replying` unless there's a VERY specific reason not to.**

Follow this decision tree:

1. **Check for manual override**
   - If user message contains `[template:X]`, use template X

2. **Check for failures/errors**
   - Did something fail/error? â†’ `error-report`

3. **Check for EXPLICIT user request for details**
   - User explicitly asked "explique", "detalhe", "o que mudou?", "como funciona?" â†’ `documentation` or `task-completion`
   - User asked architectural question â†’ `documentation`
   - Otherwise â†’ Continue to step 4

4. **Check for PR creation**
   - Did you create a PR? â†’ `pr-created`

5. **DEFAULT: Use `just-replying`**
   - Task completed successfully? â†’ `just-replying` (30-100 chars)
   - Simple question answered? â†’ `just-replying`
   - Feature implemented? â†’ `just-replying` ("âœ… Feito, PR #X")
   - Bug fixed? â†’ `just-replying` ("âœ… Corrigido")
   - Files modified? â†’ `just-replying` ("âœ… Atualizado")

**IMPORTANT:** User wants BRIEF responses by default. Only use verbose templates (`task-completion`, `documentation`) if they EXPLICITLY ask for explanation or details.

## Your Task

Analyze what you just did and output ONLY this JSON:

```json
{
  "template": "template-name",
  "reasoning": "Brief 1-sentence explanation of why this template"
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Edit
**What you did:** Edited one file to remove items from a checklist

```json
{
  "template": "just-replying",
  "reasoning": "Simple single-file edit, quick confirmation is appropriate"
}
```

### Example 2: Feature Implementation (user didn't ask for details)
**What you did:** Created new export feature with controller, tests, and types

```json
{
  "template": "just-replying",
  "reasoning": "Task completed successfully, user didn't explicitly request detailed explanation"
}
```

### Example 3: User EXPLICITLY asked "como funciona?"
**What you did:** Explained how the authentication system works in response to explicit question

```json
{
  "template": "documentation",
  "reasoning": "User explicitly asked how it works, providing technical explanation"
}
```

### Example 4: Tests Failing
**What you did:** Attempted to run tests but 5 tests failed

```json
{
  "template": "error-report",
  "reasoning": "Task incomplete due to test failures requiring attention"
}
```

### Example 5: PR Created
**What you did:** Implemented auth system and created PR #145

```json
{
  "template": "pr-created",
  "reasoning": "Pull request was created and needs review"
}
```

## Constraints

- **You have exactly 1 turn** - output the JSON and nothing else
- **Be honest** - if unsure, use `default` template
- **Check user message** - look for `[template:X]` override first

## Important Notes

- **just-replying** is the DEFAULT for 95% of cases (30-100 chars: "âœ… Feito", "âœ… Corrigido")
- **task-completion** ONLY if user explicitly asked for detailed breakdown ("explique o que fez", "detalhe as mudanÃ§as")
- **documentation** ONLY if user explicitly asked how something works ("como funciona?", "explique a arquitetura")
- **error-report** ONLY when something failed
- **pr-created** ONLY when PR was actually created
- **important-note** should RARELY be used unless manually specified
- **When in doubt, ALWAYS use `just-replying`** - user prefers brevity
