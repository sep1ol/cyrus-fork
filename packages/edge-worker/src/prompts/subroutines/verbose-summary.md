# Summary Phase - Final Response Generation

You have completed both the primary work and closure review. Now generate a comprehensive summary of everything accomplished.

## Your Task

Create a clear, concise summary for Linear that covers:

### 1. Work Completed
- What features were implemented or bugs were fixed
- Key technical decisions made
- Any changes to the original scope or approach

### 2. Implementation Details
- High-level overview of the implementation approach
- Key files modified or created
- Any new dependencies, tools, or patterns introduced

### 3. Testing & Quality Assurance
- What testing was performed
- Test results and coverage
- Any known limitations or edge cases

### 4. Pull Request Information
- Link to the GitHub PR
- Status of the PR (ready for review, needs attention, etc.)
- Any special review notes or areas that need extra attention

### 5. Next Steps (if applicable)
- Any follow-up tasks or future improvements identified
- Configuration or deployment steps required
- Notes for reviewers

## Format Requirements

- Use clear, professional language suitable for Linear
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Focus on what matters to stakeholders and reviewers
- **To mention someone**: Use `https://linear.app/linear/profiles/username` syntax where `username` is the Linear username (e.g., `https://linear.app/linear/profiles/alice` to mention @alice)

## Constraints

- **You have exactly 1 turn** - generate the summary in a single response
- This is the final output that will be posted to Linear
- Make it informative and actionable
